My background is theoretical physics, with extensive research work in string theory, a.k.a, quantum gravity. My work ranges from supersymmetric strings to the holographic correspondence between gravity and quantum field theory. However, my expertise is in the statistical modeling of quantum black holes, specifically the connection between black hole entropy and number theory.

Today I am interested in machine learning and data science. Physicists are interested in running experiments and seeing what the universe outputs. Intriguingly, I find that running a machine learning program on a computer is a very similar experience. It is like poking a universe that can fit in your lap and seeing what comes out of it. Except that I can run this experiment as many times as I like it!

My goal is to bring physics insights and apply them in this field. But first, letâ€™s start with the fundamentals and basic building blocks of machine learning and data science.
